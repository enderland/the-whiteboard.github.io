title: How to survive as a company if all your programmers win the lottery

Several years ago, I asked what seemed to be an innocuous question on a related site - [How to prepare for getting hit by a bus?](http://workplace.stackexchange.com/q/9128/2322). At the time, I was the _only_ developer on a project. And not super happy. I knew if I left, the project was going to die. 

People leave companies and teams for all sorts of reasons. Maybe taking a different job, win the lottery, or more morbidly getting hit by a bus.

This is bad enough when you have a single person working on a small team in a large mega-corporation. But companies with 50,000+ people can survive single people quitting and 'sinking' projects. 

But what if your company is small? If you have a small team with only a few developers in your entire _company_ then what happens if they all leave? Your company is in far worse shape than a megacorp with ---money to burn--- stability.

# __What is a bus factor?__

The phrase "bus factor" is often used in considerations like this. It basically refers to the number of people who are in positions in a company, project, or team that are critical for the project success. For example, a team of two people both working on a small project with roughly equal contributions could result in that project having a bus factor of 2. Both those people would have to quit before the project would be critically doomed to failure.

Practically speaking it is often difficult to identify a bus number. If your company has 10 people, with 3 people doing all the development you may have a bus number of 3. But if two of them are junior and the third is the sole heavy lifter, you still might have a bus number of 1. 

This is really, really important to understand. **Having a team doesn't automatically increase your bus number.** The “bus number” is entirely dependent on how few people would have to leave before a project fails. It might be all of the team or only a few key individuals.

A related and important point is that project failure can mean different things. Some projects may “fail” simply by being delivered late. Others require the project to be abandoned before declaring failure.

# __What causes a more plausible bus factor event?__

It is pretty unlikely an entire development team will literally get hit by a bus at the same time. Or even that they will win an office lottery pool and suddenly find minimal incentive to come to work. These are pretty low odds. And most small company owners can mitigate the latter simply by playing in the pool themselves…

Perhaps more worrisome are less obvious and less dramatic busses. Maybe multiple key people simultaneously find other employment. Maybe the office environment sucks and once one person leaves, everyone else realizes they do not have to put up with crap and also leave. 

This slow bus hit can happen over the course of several weeks or even months. It often takes months to replace senior individuals (who more likely are involved in bus factors).

# __How bad is this for a small company?__

There is really no way around it. Anything like this happening, even if it’s a gradual progression over a few months, is bad news for a company. The entire concept of a “bus number” is that you are pretty much screwed if it happens. 

Larger companies can just accept a huge financial hit and move forward. Smaller companies cannot. 

# __Risk mitigation: how to prevent this from destroying you__

First, hire good people. An organization full of smart people is an insurance against a bus factor. Smart people can quickly adapt and learn new things. Your bus factor might be 1 but at least if that person wins the lottery, you have people who can eventually fill in their responsibilities. Naturally you need to try to keep people, a subject which could be an entire blog post of its own, but do not make work environments horrible.

Second, documentation. Keep some sort of record for major decisions. If you are not using a version control system get one yesterday. Try to avoid making large scale planning decisions without capturing them. This might be as simple as emailed meeting notes. It might be as complex as long specifications documents. Having _something_ to look at though in the event that happens is important.

Code reviews are also helpful, even if cursory. It provides a smoke check - if during a review you have no clue what large portions of a codebase is doing, odds are your bus factor is lower than if you understand it (hey at least if someone else can grok it, it sort of makes sense). It gives opportunities to do knowledge share.
